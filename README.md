# Inform ATTACK

Inform ATTACK is not really being maintained here currently. Although in the future we would like to update this again, for now changes are being made in the Kerkerkruip repository:

#Updater's note

A couple of notes about my update. As of the time of writing, I only fixed the issues that prevent compilation when this extension is paired with minimal code. If anyone notices any further errors or bugs, I will try to fix it when notified. Also, for those interested in re-checking my work, my updates are marked with a comment starting with the phrase "update note:".
