Volume - Introduction

Include version 5/131204 of Inform ATTACK Core by Victor Gijsbers.
[Include Plurality by Emily Short.] [Deprecated with Inform 6L02.]

Section - Saying combat numbers

[ See manual section 2.1.2 ]

[ This variable determines whether we see numerical output. ]
The numbers boolean is a truth state variable. The numbers boolean is true.

Checking the numbers boolean is an action out of world. Understand "numbers" as checking the numbers boolean.
Carry out checking the numbers boolean (this is the standard checking the numbers boolean rule):
	say "Combat-related numbers will be [if the numbers boolean is true]displayed[otherwise]hidden[end if].".

Switching the numbers off is an action out of world. Understand "numbers off" as switching the numbers off.
Carry out switching the numbers off (this is the standard switching the numbers off rule):
	now the numbers boolean is false;
	say "You will no longer see combat-related numbers.".

Switching the numbers on is an action out of world. Understand "numbers on" as switching the numbers on.
Carry out switching the numbers on (this is the standard switching the numbers on rule):
	now the numbers boolean is true;
	say "You will now see combat-related numbers.".

Section - The After reporting rules

[ The reporting rules are supposed to have the last word, but in Inform ATTACK sometimes that's just not acceptable. The After reporting rules allow us to get another word in. Like the After rules, they are shared for all (non out of world) actions. ]
The after reporting rules are a rulebook.

A specific action-processing rule (this is the after reporting stage rule):
	if action in world is true:
		abide by the after reporting rules.

Section - New verbs

To lunge is a verb.
To miss is a verb.


Volume - The Main System

[The Main System covers the basics of combat, and creates rulebooks for all other systems to fit into.]



Book - Dressing up the Person Class

[ These adjectives will make reporting attacks a lot easier! ]
Definition: a person is a pc rather than an npc if it is the player.

Chapter - Looting

[To make looting possible.]
The can't take people's possessions rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take living people's possessions rule):
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	let H be the not-counting-parts holder of the noun;
	while H is not nothing and H is not the local ceiling:
		if H is an alive person:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "[regarding the noun][Those] [seem] to belong to [the H]." (A);
		let H be the not-counting-parts holder of H;

After examining a dead person (this is the give list of possession on dead person rule):
	if the number of things carried by the noun is at least one:
		say "On the [if the noun is plural-named]bodies[otherwise]body[end if] of [the noun] you also see [list of things carried by the noun with indefinite articles].".

Chapter - Health

A person has a number called permanent health. [The maximum you can regain with healing.]

When play begins (this is the set permanent health to initial health rule):
	repeat with the patient running through people:
		now the permanent health of the patient is the health of the patient;

[We set the permanent health of each individual to the health it has at the beginning of the game. If we wish any character to start the game wounded or super-healthy, we will have to manually override this process.]

To restore the health of (patient - a person):
	now the health of the patient is the permanent health of the patient. 

To fully heal (patient - a person):
	if the permanent health of the patient is greater than the health of the patient:
		restore the health of the patient.

[The healed amount is a number that varies. The healed amount is usually 0.]

To heal (patient - a person) for (health - a number) health:
	let the health dummy be the permanent health of the patient minus the health of the patient;
	if health is less than the health dummy:
		now the health dummy is health;
	if the health dummy is less than 0:
		now the health dummy is 0;
	increase the health of the patient by the health dummy;
	[now the healed amount is the health dummy.] [For storage.]

Chapter - Basic Combat Stats

[Melee is a measure of fighting prowess. Higher melee means higher chance to hit.]
A person has a number called melee. The melee of a person is usually 0. 

[Defence is a measure of fighting prowess. Higher defence means less chance to get hit.]
A person has a number called defence. The defence of a person is usually 7.



Book - Weapons

Chapter - The weapon kind

A weapon is a kind of thing.

[ A readied weapon is one that is not just carried by the actor, but actually in use. ]
A weapon can be readied. A weapon is usually not readied.

After printing the name of a readied weapon while taking inventory (this is the readied inventory listing rule):
	say " (readied)".

[ The damage die is the die size used to calculate damage. Base damage dealt by the weapon is 1d(damage die) + weapon damage bonus. So a standard weapon deals 1d6 damage; a weapon with a damage die of 0 and a weapon damage bonus of 5 always deals 5 damage, and so on. Negative damage die is counted as 0, but negative weapon damage bonus is possible. ]
A weapon has a number called the damage die. The damage die of a weapon is usually 6.
A weapon has a number called the weapon damage bonus. The weapon damage bonus of a weapon is usually 0.

A weapon has a number called the dodge bonus. The dodge bonus of a weapon is usually 0.

		if n is greater than 0:
			say " + ", n, " ([the global attacker weapon] bonus)[run paragraph on]";
		if n is less than 0:
			say " - ", 0 minus n, " ([the global attacker weapon] penalty)[run paragraph on]";
	increase the attack strength by n.

Chance to win rule (this is the CTW attack bonus from weapon rule):
	increase the chance-to-win by the weapon attack bonus of the chosen weapon.

Section - Natural weapons

A natural weapon is a kind of weapon.
A natural weapon is part of every person.
A natural weapon is usually privately-named.

The description of a natural weapon is usually "Clenched fists, kicking feet--that kind of stuff."

The damage die of a natural weapon is usually 3. The dodge bonus of a natural weapon is usually 0. The parry-against bonus of a natural weapon is usually 0. The parry-with bonus of a natural weapon is usually -2.

Does the player mean readying a natural weapon:

Book - Combat Round

Chapter - The hitting action

The global attacker is a person variable.
The global defender is a person variable.
The global attacker weapon is a weapon variable.
The global defender weapon is a weapon variable.

The attack strength is a number variable.

[ The old system has been converted into an action. Instead of the old entry point system we now have:
	1: does attacking begin?
		add check an actor hitting rules
	2: preliminary results of attacking
		add first carry out an actor hitting rules
	3-6: basic attack roll, apply the attack modifiers, calculate results of the attack roll, show results of the attack roll
		these have been combined into the attack modifier rules
	7: did the attack hit?
		changed to first contact rules
	8: immediate results of hitting
		add contact rules
	9-10: rolling the die for damage, modifying the damage
		these have been combined into the damage modifier rules
	11-12: calculating the final damage, showing the damage
		these have been combined into the damage multiplier rules
	13: pre-prose-generation effects
		add after an actor hitting rules
	14: reporting the results of the blow
		the flavour rules have been changed to report an actor hitting rules
	15: aftereffects
		unchanged
	16: remove temporary circumstances
		changed to after an actor hitting rules
	17: final report
		Gone. Could add last aftereffects or last after reporting rules

Book - Artificial Intelligence

[ Our standard AI works in three stages.
	First, we choose a person to attack--if we were to attack.
	In the second stage, we choose a weapon.
	In the third stage, we decide whether to attack or whether to do something else--like concentrating, dodging, readying a weapon, and so on.
	
These choices are made by a series of rulebooks which alter the weighting of each potential target/weapon/action.

Inform ATTACK Core has the base rules - we now add combat specific ones. ]

Volume - Plug-ins

Chapter - Reloadable Weapons (Standard Plug-in)

A weapon has a number called the maximum shots. The maximum shots of a weapon is usually 0.
A weapon has a number called the current shots. The current shots of a weapon is usually 0.
A weapon has a number called the maximum load time. The maximum load time of a weapon is usually 0. 
A weapon has a number called the current load time. The current load time of a weapon is usually 0.

Definition: a weapon is unloaded if its current shots is 0 and its maximum shots is greater than 0.
Definition: a weapon is waiting to be reloaded if its current shots is 0 and its maximum shots is greater than 0 and its maximum load time is greater than 0.

A weapon has a text called the shots text. The shots text of a weapon is usually "shots".
A weapon has a text called the reload text. The reload text of a weapon is usually "reload".
A weapon has a text called the reload stem text. The reload stem text of a weapon is usually "reload".
A weapon has a text called the out of ammo text. The out of ammo text of a weapon is usually "You pull the trigger, but nothing happens--you're out of ammo!".

[Maximum shots: number of rounds the weapon can be used when fully loaded. Current shots: number of shots still loaded. Maximum load time: number of rounds it takes to load the weapon. Current load time: number of rounds it still takes to load the weapon.]

[Set maximum shots to 0 for any weapon that shouldn't use these statistics. Set maximum load time to -1 in case a weapon cannot be reloaded. NEVER set maximum load time to 0 for a weapon with maximum shots not 0.]

[The basic system does NOT deal with ammo. Everyone is assumed to have infinite ammunition.]

After printing the name of a weapon (called item) when taking inventory (this is the show ammo in inventory rule):
	if the maximum shots of item is not 0:
		if the current shots of item is not 0:
			say " ([current shots of item] of [maximum shots of item] [shots text of item] left)";
		otherwise:
			if the maximum load time of item is not -1:
				say " (no [shots text of item] left; [current load time of item] round[if current load time of item is not 1]s[otherwise] to [reload text of item])";
			otherwise:
				say " (no [shots text of item] left; cannot be [reload stem text of item]ed)".

After an actor hitting when the maximum shots of the global attacker weapon is greater than 0 (this is the decrease ammo rule):
	decrease the current shots of the global attacker weapon by 1;
	continue the action;

Check attacking (this is the cannot attack when out of ammo rule):
	let item be a random readied weapon enclosed by the player;
	if the maximum shots of item is greater than 0 and the current shots of item is not greater than 0:
		say "[out of ammo text of item][paragraph break]" instead.

Section - Reloading

Reloading is an action applying to one carried thing.

Understand "reload [held weapon]" as reloading.

Does the player mean reloading an unloaded readied weapon enclosed by the player: it is very likely.
Does the player mean reloading an unloaded weapon enclosed by the player: it is likely.

Check reloading when the maximum shots of the noun is 0 (this is the cannot reload weapons that use no ammo rule):
	take no time;
	say "[The noun] does not use ammunition." instead;
	
Check reloading when the maximum load time of the noun is -1 (this is the cannot reload unreloadable weapons rule):	
	take no time;
	say "[The noun] cannot be [reload stem text of the noun]ed." instead;
	
Check reloading when the current shots of the noun is the maximum shots of the noun (this is the cannot reload fully loaded weapons rule):	
	take no time;
	say "[The noun] is already loaded." instead.

Carry out an actor reloading a not readied weapon (this is the ready upon reloading rule):
	silently try readying the noun;

Carry out an actor reloading (this is the zero current ammo on reloading rule):
	now current shots of the noun is 0.
	
Carry out an actor reloading (this is the standard carry out reloading rule):
	decrease the current load time of the noun by 1;
	if the current load time of the noun is less than 1:
		now the current shots of the noun is the maximum shots of the noun;
		now the current load time of the noun is the maximum load time of the noun.
	
Report an actor reloading (this is the standard report reloading rule):
	if the current load time of the noun is the maximum load time of the noun:
		say "[The actor] [if the maximum load time of the noun is 1][reload text of the noun][s][otherwise]finish[es] [reload stem text of the noun]ing[end if] [the noun].";
	otherwise:
		say "[The actor] [if the current load time of the noun plus 1 is the maximum load time of the noun]start[s][otherwise]continue[s][end if] [reload stem text of the noun]ing [the noun].".

Section - Reloading and choosing a weapon AI rules

[Weapons with high load times and limited ammo should not be given a penalty if they are already readied and full; some penalty if they are not readied; and a larger penalty if they are not readied and out of ammo.]

[ Move unloaded into the preample? ]
An AI weapon selection rule for an unloaded weapon (called W) (this is the do not choose an empty weapon that cannot be reloaded rule):
	if the maximum load time of W is -1:
		decrease the Weight by 1000;

An AI weapon selection rule for a weapon (called W) (this is the do not prefer weapons that need to be reloaded rule):
	if W is not readied or the current shots of W is 0:
		if the maximum shots of the W is not 0:
			if the maximum load time of the W is greater than 0:
				let m be the maximum shots of the W;
				let n be the maximum load time of the W;
				let x be m times 10;
				let y be m + n;
				now x is x divided by y; [Now x is roughly 10 times the fraction of time spent shooting in a shoot-reload cycle.]
				now x is 10 minus x; [Now x is roughly 10 times the fraction of time NOT spent shooting in a shoot-reload cycle.]
				if the current shots of the W is not 0: [This means that the weapon is (somewhat) loaded, but not ready. Using such a weapon can be done without ever reloading it: we ready it, shoot until empty, then ready a new weapon. This is AS IF we had to reload for two rounds in order to shoot as many shots as the weapon currently has. We now calculate this, and if it's better than the previous calculation, we substitute it for it.]
					now n is 2;
					now m is the current shots of the W;
					let z be m times 10;
					let y be m + n;
					now z is z divided by y;
					now z is 10 minus z;
					if z is less than x, now x is z;
				decrease the Weight by x;
	
[Example: a weapon that takes 1 turn to reload and gives you 1 shot gets a -5 penalty. A weapon that takes 3 turns to reload and gives you 1 shot gets a -8 penalty. A weapon that takes 1 turn to reload and gives you 5 shots gets a -2 penalty. ]

[Weapons with 0 ammo and a maximum load time of -1 should NOT be chosen.]

[ We will only load an unloaded weapon. ]
First AI action selection rule for a person (called P) when the chosen weapon is waiting to be reloaded (this is the consider reloading rule):
	choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Option entry is the action of P reloading the chosen weapon;
	now the Action Weight entry is 5.

An AI action selection rule for a person (called P) when the chosen weapon is unloaded (this is the don't attack or concentrate with an unloaded weapon rule):
	if P is at-Act:
		choose row with an Option of the action of P attacking the chosen target in the Table of AI Action Options;
		now the Action Weight entry is -1000;
	choose row with an Option of the action of P concentrating in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Action Weight entry is -100;



Chapter - Tension (Standard Plug-in)

[Tension is a standard plug-in, since I believe almost any game will benefit from it. Tension is a kind of "drama manager" for combat: it makes sure that long periods in which no apparent progress is made--that is, in which no damage is done--are not experienced as boring, but rather as increasing the tension. The way it works is that every turn when no hit is scored, the tension (a number that varies) is increased by one. High tension gives everyone bonuses on the attack roll, thus increasing the likelihood that something will happen, and on the attack damage roll, thus increasing the stakes.

Tension also works as a check and balance on the combat system: if you have made it too hard for people to hit each other, tension will greatly alleviate this problem.]

The tension is a number that varies. The tension is usually 0.

Every turn (this is the standard increase or reset the tension rule):
	if the combat status is peace:
		now the tension is 0;
	otherwise:
		increase the tension by 1;
		if the tension is greater than 20:
			now the tension is 20.

This is the additional reset the tension rule:
	if combat status is peace:
		now tension is 0.
	
The additional reset the tension rule is listed before the business as usual rule in the combat round rules.	
	
An attack modifier rule (this is the standard tension attack modifier rule):
	let the tension bonus be the tension divided by 2;
	if the tension bonus is not 0:
		if the numbers boolean is true:
			say " + ", the tension bonus, " (tension)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack strength by the tension bonus;
		
A damage modifier rule (this is the standard tension damage modifier rule):
	let the bonus be the tension divided by 3;
	if the bonus is not 0:
		if the numbers boolean is true:
			say " + ", the bonus, " (tension)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack damage by the bonus.

An aftereffects rule when the attack damage is greater than 0 (this is the standard reduce tension after hit rule):		
	now the tension is the tension minus 4;
	now the tension is the tension times 8;
	now the tension is the tension divided by 10;
	if the tension is less than 0:
		now the tension is 0;

[A hit must reduce the tension, but not necessarily completely down to 0. We want low tensions to be completely removed by a hit, but larger tension to be removed only partly. The standard rule leads to the following table:

0 -> 0
1 -> 0
2 -> 0
3 -> 0
4 -> 0
5 -> 0
6 -> 1
7 -> 2
8 -> 2
9 -> 3
10 -> 4
11 -> 4
12 -> 5
13 -> 6
14 -> 7
15 -> 7
16 -> 8
17 -> 9
18 -> 9
19 -> 10
20 -> 11

So if the current tension is 10, my attack will have an attack bonus of +5 and a damage bonus of +3. If I hit, the tension will drop to 4, will then be immediately raised to 5 by the every turn rule, and my opponent's attack the next round will be made at a +2 to attack and +1 to damage.

You can see that if the current tension is 10 and I am maximally concentrated, my attack is made at a gigantic +13 attack bonus, and will deliver a +7 damage bonus. ]
		
Chance to win rule (this is the CTW tension bonus rule):
	increase the chance-to-win by the tension divided by 2.

An AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) (this is the tension influences attacking rule):
	choose row with an Option of the action of P attacking the chosen target in the Table of AI Action Options;
	increase the Action Weight entry by the tension divided by 4.
